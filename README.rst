Features
========

* `Julia's Multimedia I/O`_ hooked into `IPython's display system`_
* Code completion inside Julia magic (by **monkey-patching** IPython)
* ``@async`` works in Jupyter (Julia's event loop is integrated to
  ipykernel's asyncio event loop)
* ``print`` works in Jupyter (Julia's standard streams are integrated
  to ipykernel's I/O)
* Syntax highlighting works in ``%%julia`` magic of ``ipython`` CLI
  (but not in Jupyter)
* Copy-free access to Julia objects from Python

Those are build on top of the great libraries PyCall.jl_ and PyJulia_.
(It would be nice to merge some features to PyJulia_ at some point.
But I wanted to do some experiments on Python interface for handling
Julia objects.)
