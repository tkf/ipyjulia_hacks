Features
========

* `Julia's Multimedia I/O`_ hooked into `IPython's display system`_
* Code completion inside Julia magic (by **monkey-patching** IPython)
* Copy-free access to Julia objects from IPython

Those are build on top of the great libraries PyCall.jl_ and PyJulia_.
(It would be nice to merge some features to PyJulia_ at some point.
But I wanted to do some experiments on Python interface for handling
Julia objects.)

Installation
============

Pretty much everything has to be installed from development version::

  pip install https://github.com/ipython/ipython/archive/master.zip#egg=ipython
  pip install https://github.com/tkf/pyjulia/archive/venv.zip#egg=julia
  pip install https://github.com/tkf/ipyjulia_hacks/archive/master.zip#egg=ipyjulia_hacks
